## Aim
To generate a native terminal application which can be used to browse, download/upload files and sync your Google Drive with a local folder.

## Installation
Ensure you have a reasonably updated version of `node` and `npm` on your PC.

Clone this repository and then follow the instructions below:
``` bash
$ cd drive-sync/
$ npm link
```

## Usage
Currently the working CLI options include:

- ls
	- `Usage: $ drive-sync ls`
	- `Description: List files in current folder.`

## Technologies
NodeJS, God knows what else.
